            <p>In this website I sent in production an algorithm capable of predicting if in a wall/concrete picture there is
                a crack. This is possible through a Computer Vision algorithm called Convolutional Neural Networks that has been trained
            on pictures containing cracks and not.</p>
            <p>Lets try it!</p>
